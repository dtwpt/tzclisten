## TZCListen - Trezarcoin Transaction Visualizer ##

Realtime Trezarcoin transaction visualizer written in HTML/Javascript. See and hear new transactions and blocks as they propagate through the Trezarcoin Network.

### Building ###

The project is built and ready-to-go. If you change any of the javascript, you will need to re-build the `tzclisten.min.js` file using Grunt. If you haven't used Grunt before, here is a short tutorial:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/).

2. Install grunt-cli using `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`.

2. Cd into the project directory and run `npm install` to install the proper Grunt version and dependencies for this project.

3. Run `grunt` to build BitListen. Alternatively, run `grunt watch` to build BitListen, host it at http://localhost:8000, and watch for and rebuild changes in the source files.

The compiled/minified script will be output to `tzclisten.min.js`.
